# ReadTrack365

Welcome to my Daily Reading Log! This repository is where I keep track of all the books, articles, and papers I read each day. I've created this as a way to motivate myself to read consistently, track my progress, and reflect on the material I've explored.

## Motivation
The idea behind creating this log is to build a habit of daily reading and learning. By keeping a log, I can see my progress, discover patterns in my reading preferences, and ensure I'm diversifying the content I consume.

## How It Works
Each day, I log the following details about my reading:

- Date: When I read the material.
- Title: The title of the book or article.
- Author(s): Who wrote it.
- Pages Read: Number of pages I read (for books) or the length of the article.
- Key Takeaways: A few bullet points on the main insights or ideas from the reading.
- Link: If available, a link to the reading material or where it can be purchased.
- Structure
The repository is organized by month and year for easy navigation. Each month has its own folder, and within each folder, there's a markdown file for each day's log.

## Goals
- Read daily: Even if it's just a page or an article.
- Diversify content: Ensure a good mix of fiction, non-fiction, technical papers, and leisure reading.
- Reflect: Spend a few minutes summarizing key points to better retain and understand the material.
Feel free to explore my reading journey, and perhaps start one of your own!
